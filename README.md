Smith-William
=============
Hi! My name is Rob Smith and I will be working with the Gapminder data set. I am a returning student, double majoring in Statistics and Political Science. I enjoy keeping up with world events, light exercise, listening to music and playing when I can, good food, fun people, and especially learning new things. I'm looking forward to getting a hands-on experience with modern methods of collaboration and communication in the world of statistical research.
